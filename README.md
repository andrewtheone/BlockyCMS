# BlockyCMS
Blocky CMS is a flexible, extendable content management system.
It uses RedBeanPHP as a database manager, we decided to use it because it dynamically creates and alters tables.

In BCMS everything is an extension, except for the core.. :P

# Extensions
Extensions are capable of:
- Register front and backend routes
- Create/Extend configuration and other extensions' config file
- Provide ContentTypes
- Provide FieldTypes
- Provide Services
- Provide Twig view namespaces
- Provide Twig functions and filters
- Register event listeners
